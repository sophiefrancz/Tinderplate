# Design for Physical Prototyping


## Read me
Only edit the content in the [content/docs/projects/our_project](https://github.com/pretoms/dpp_docs/tree/main/content/docs/projects/our_project) folder (which will be rendered as [this]({{< ref "our_project" >}})). This is also the folder to be handed in at the end of the semester. Rename the folder to your projects title. The total size should not exceed **20 MB**. GIFs are encouraged to demonstrate movement in your prototype. 
The current content content provides an exemplary structure for the documentation but can be freely adapted to your needs. Write in a way so that the documentation would be useful for your pre-project self.
